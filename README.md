Hello, my name is Bona O'Quinn, I currently studying computer science at Grossmont College. 
Before taking intro to Java in High School I would not have chosen Comp Sci at my major.
But here we are :).
Besides that I am very interested in music and I play the guitar.
I wanted to start my own repository, but I am a first time user of GitHub. 
So if you have any advice or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.

Hello, my name is Bona O'Quinn, I currently studying computer science at San Diego State University. 
Before taking intro to Java in High School I would not have chosen Comp Sci at my major.
But here we are :). So far this is a place where I am storing school based projects in Java and C++. 
I am planning on adding personal projects as well.
